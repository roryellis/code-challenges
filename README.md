Solutions to various code challenges for ongoing skills practice

# Prompt Obscurity
Due to the desire for future learners to experience the growth and accomplishment that comes with developing solutions to code-challenges on their own, and in accordance with requests and guidelines from the source of many of these types of challenges, I will not be including references to the official challenge prompts that these solutions are intended to address. With slight modification, these solutions serve as examples of my thought process and work while I hone my skillset, without spoiling the learning process for others.
